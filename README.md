# law-firm-website

Since the creation of the World Wide Web, websites have been used to distribute information over the internet. These websites cover a broad range of topics and serve many different purposes depending on who the developers intend to be the audience. In more recent years, large corporations and businesses have taken to creating their own websites to advertise their products and services to garner more customers. Law firms, in particular, have become even more dependent on these websites as it is the easiest and quickest way to expand their clientele. By having websites, law firms can easily advertise the numerous areas that they practice in as well as give detailed information about the best ways future or current clients can contact them for further information or assistance.

For my senior seminar project, I developed a law firm website to be used for professional practice. I created a database that would store user information, blog posts, reviews, and legal information. While doing this, I also created various pages that displayed information about the law firm and its practices. Then, I connected the web pages to the database to complete the main portion of the project.
